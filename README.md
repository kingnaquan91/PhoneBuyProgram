# PhoneBuyProgram
Challenge 1 of Infrastructure Developer Training - Phone Buying Program

Write a program to calculate the total price of phones with accesories purchase. 

1)  You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of money in your budget. Keep track of how many phones you buy.
2)  You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your total purchase amount is below your budget. Keep track of how many accessories you buy.

After you've calculated your purchase amount, 

Add in the tax
Check your bank balance
Print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.
Also print out a message if you cannot afford the purchase

You should set up some constants for the "tax rate," "phone price," "accessory price," and “budget," as well as a variable for your "bank account balance.“

You should define functions for calculating the tax and for formatting the price with a "$" and rounding to two decimal places.

Bonus Challenge: Try to incorporate input into this program, perhaps with the prompt(..) covered in "Input" earlier. You may prompt the user for their bank account balance, for example. Have fun and be creative!

You will be given a file with pseudocode to help you organize your program.
